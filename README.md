Workflow 
1. Commit&Push your work to your branch.
2. Create a PR(Pull Request) and Merge your branch to main.
3. Switch to the main branch and pull so you can get updates from other collaborators.
4. Create a new branch and start your new work...
5. Back to 1.

Do NOT write and push on main branch directly! Always work on a branch and merge after.
Make sure to pull on main for changes before you start to work (creating a new branch).
